# SampleGulpSite

First install required packages on command line at project root (Requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/))
```
npm install
```

After making what changes you want you must compile the output
```
gulp
```

And in order to run the website we'll be using the project [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server)
From the build directory, on the command line run:
```
lite-server
``

(Or alternatively as lite-server is defined in the package.json)
```
npm start
```
